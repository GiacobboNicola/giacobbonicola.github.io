			<p>Even if I really love doing research (or at least I love trying) and it takes most of my time, 
				my interests and passions are not limited to it.<p>
			<p>I like to think of myself as a person who does never get tired to learn and who is curious 
				about everything around itself.</p>
			<p>One of my passions is travelling because It lets us the opportunity to discover new places and
				different cultures. Iâ€™m also an amateur photographer (and you can see some works 
				<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/139061948@N07/">here</a>) as well as a terrible chess player, 
				even if I really like to play <span class='o';)</span>.</p>
			<p>In my free time, I also try to do more sport as possible. In particular, I love to ride my mountain 
				bike up and down on the few hills available in Padova. I also enjoy practising tennis and jogging 
				with my girlfriend.</p>
			<p>Thanks for visiting my corner of the internet!</p>
